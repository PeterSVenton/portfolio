# Personal Portfolio

## Todo
- Add custom 404 page
- Store mdx files in centralised folder and transpile to html for AWS knowledge base
- Setup AWS knowledge base with agent/gpt like screen
- Write 5-10 work articles
- Add Breadcrumbs / TOC to mdx pages


## Article Ideas
- Designing scalable/futureproof dashboards/reports (i.e. dead stock measures are future proof but cost to serve isn't because cost to serve was written without dax knowledge. BOXI reports didn't have dynamic groups, just variables per warehouse so a new warehouse meant updating a bunch of reports)
