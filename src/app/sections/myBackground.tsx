      I’ve never been someone who’s okay with “that’s just how it works.” Even during my business degree, I found myself digging into the technical side — teaching myself how to build apps and APIs just to understand what powered the tools we all relied on.
    </p>

    <p>
      That mindset carried over into my BI work. I quickly realized that many of the reports I was expected to work with were built on shaky foundations — overly complex, poorly modeled, or misunderstood by the people using them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding the deeper layers — from how a query works to how an app talks to an API — gives me the clarity to ask better questions, fix broken things, and build BI solutions that make sense. I love designing end-to-end solutions, and I’m always looking to bring that mindset to businesses that want more than just dashboards — they want systems that actually work.
