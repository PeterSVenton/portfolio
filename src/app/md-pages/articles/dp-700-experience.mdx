# DP-700: Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate

I recently took the [DP-700: Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-data-engineer-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification) exam and am now [certified](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/PeterVenton-7649/A850B1056A30CBE8?sharingId=98B7CA95EDAFB390).

## Why I pursued it

With the introduction of **Microsoft Fabric**, the data engineering landscape within the Microsoft ecosystem has evolved significantly. The DP-700 certification validates skills in **designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines and analytics solutions** that leverage Fabric’s unified architecture across Data Factory, DataFlows, Realtime Analytics, Pyspark, and Lakehouses.

For me, this certification was a natural next step after working extensively with **Power BI, Python, and SQL**. It offered a way to formalize my experience and stay ahead as the platform continues to unify analytics under Fabric.

## What the exam covers

The DP-700 exam focuses on several key areas:

- **Ingesting and transforming data** using Dataflows Gen2, Pipelines, and Lakehouses  
- **Designing and implementing data models** for performance and scalability  
- **Managing and optimizing data storage** in OneLake  
- **Enabling analytics and business intelligence** with Direct Lake and Power BI integration  
- **Monitoring, securing, and governing Fabric environments**

Overall, it’s about understanding how all the Fabric components fit together to support an end-to-end data strategy.

## Study resources I used

- [Microsoft Learn Path for DP-700](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/dp-700t00)  
- [Microsoft Fabric documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/)  
- [Practice Exam from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-data-engineer-associate/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=1704375541&practice-assessment-type=certification)  
- Aleksi Partanen's 11 hour [DP-700 Exam Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTDSP7KBavI)
- Will's 6 hour [DP-700 Exam Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiB4eAeFRsw)

Outside of this I gained hands on experience by leveraging the free 60 day Fabric trial from Microsoft to have access to play with Fabric and solidify my understanding of all the content.

Overall I studied for 4 weeks before taking the exam, scoring a 883/1000.

## My experience taking the exam

The exam experience was relatively smooth **40–50 questions** covering a balance of conceptual design, and technical questions with a case study to evaluate a scenario based task.

For the conceptual design tasks I found it helpful to visualize Fabric as an ecosystem: knowing when to use Dataflows, Pipelines, and Lakehouses in combination was key.

For the techical questions its about knowing syntax, functions and method names. The easiest way to develop the skills needed in this section is to utilize a hands on approach, especially if you've never done any PySpark. The 3 topics covered are:
1. **PySpark / Fabric Notebooks**
    - If you're familiar with Python/Pandas then this is mainly about learning PySpark syntax.
    - There were a few questions about the Fabric Specific Package NoteBookUtils, which asked how to orchestrate other notebooks from within a notebook (This is a question about NoteBookUtils `runMultiple()` method and the syntax of the dictionary to setup the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG))
2. **SQL**
    - How to GRANT permission to objects in the database
    - Setting up RLS in SQL by creating a security predicate and binding it to a table
    - The different dynamic data masking (DDM) functions fabric supports and when to make use of them
3. **KQL**
    - How to create Materialized Views and what their use case is
    - How to create functions and their difference to SQL stored procedures

## What’s next

With Fabric now at the core of Microsoft’s analytics offering, this certification feels like a great foundation for future roles focused on **data architecture, governance, and analytics enablement**.  
I plan to continue exploring Fabric’s end-to-end capabilities, particularly **Real-Time Intelligence** and **Data Activator**. The next certification I'm chasing is the DP600:
