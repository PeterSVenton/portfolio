# PL-300: Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate

I recently took the [PL-300: Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/) exam and successfully achieved the [certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/PeterVenton-7649/71633D935ED58B98?sharingId=98B7CA95EDAFB390).

## Why I pursued it

Power BI continues to be one of the most widely used analytics and business intelligence platforms, and the PL-300 exam validates the core skills needed to work effectively as a data analyst.  
For me, the certification was a natural fit given my work in transforming data, designing semantic models, and building insight driven dashboards that support decision making.

---

## What the exam covers

The PL-300 focuses on practical, end to end analytics capability:

- Preparing and cleaning data for analysis  
- Modelling data with DAX, relationships, and performance optimisations  
- Creating reports and dashboards that communicate insights clearly  
- Applying governance concepts including row level security and data sensitivity labels  
- Deploying and managing solutions within the Power BI service  

It is a hands on exam that tests both technical skill and the ability to design intuitive, high quality analytical experiences.

## Study resources I used

- Microsoft Learn PL-300 Learning Path  
- Official Power BI Documentation  
- Hands on practice at work to design semantic models, write DAX, and optimise report performance  

Since I use PowerBI so regularaly as part of my job I was able to take the exam without a lot of preparation.

---

## My experience taking the exam

The exam included 40 to 50 questions across conceptual modelling, DAX, scenario based report design, and Power BI Service functionality.

Some themes I found especially important:

- DAX fundamentals and syntax such as CALCULATE, FILTER, and context transitions  
- Data modelling best practices including star schema, cardinality, and relationship directions  
- Transformations in Power Query, especially M language behaviours  
- Publishing and managing datasets in the Power BI Service  
- Implementing row level security effectively  

The exam felt balanced, with a strong emphasis on practical understanding rather than memorisation.

## What’s next

The PL-300 provides a solid foundation for analytics engineering and BI roles. Having already completed the DP-700 and DP-600, my next step is to expand beyond Fabric and build deeper cloud expertise through Azure certifications.
