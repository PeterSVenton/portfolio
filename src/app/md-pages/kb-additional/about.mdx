# About Peter Venton

I’m **Peter Venton**, a London based data engineer and analyst focused on creating scalable data ecosystems, not just individual dashboards.

---

## Philosophy

I believe that great in-house analytics starts with **structure**: thoughtful data modelling, centralized measures, and a shared semantic layer that powers dashboards, apps, and insights with clarity and consistency.

My core principles:
- **Shared model first.** Thin reports sit on top of a governed semantic layer.
- **Name it once, reuse everywhere.** Eliminate duplicated metrics and logic.
- **Design for change.** New questions shouldn’t require rewrites.
- **Trust and protection.** Apply correct model boundaries, RLS/OLS, and governance.

---

## What I Do

- Work across the stack — **SQL**, **Python**, **Azure/Fabric**, **Power BI**, and **AWS**.
- Specialise in **semantic modelling**, **governance**, **time-intelligence**, and **regimented transformation pipelines**.
- Deliver projects that are **auditable**, **maintainable**, and **measurable** in business outcomes.

---

## Highlights

- **Migrated** legacy SAP BusinessObjects (BOXI) reports to Power BI Paginated Reports and modern data architectures.
- **Designed and maintained** semantic models for Sales, Stock, and Finance with centralized DAX measures.
- **Built** peterventon.co.uk to demonstrate skills in **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **AWS**.
