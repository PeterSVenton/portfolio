# Programming Languages

This page summarises the programming and query languages I work with on a regular basis. For each language, I describe my level of fluency, how I typically use it, and the parts of the ecosystem I work with most often. The goal is to give a clear, natural explanation of how these skills show up in real projects rather than a list of isolated features.

# Python (Fluent)

Python is one of my core languages and something I use across a wide range of projects. It fits well for analytics work, data engineering, backend APIs and general automation. I also rely on it when I want to prototype an idea quickly or build tools that help with day to day tasks.

## Uses
- FastAPI
- Django
- AWS Lambda Functions
- Microsoft Fabric tasks and notebooks
- Automation scripts and coding events
- Data analysis and statistics
- Machine learning model experiments
- Web scraping
- CLI tools
- Internal analytics engineering utilities

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- PySpark
- Django
- FastAPI with Pydantic models
- Requests and HTTPX
- Jupyter and IPython

# SQL (Fluent)

SQL is part of my daily workflow. Most of my use involves analytics engineering, designing data models and writing transformations for reporting. I focus on writing clean queries, building reliable pipelines and making sure the data structures behind dashboards are solid and efficient.

## Uses
- Creating data models for analytics
- ETL and ELT transformations
- Analytical queries such as aggregates and window functions
- Data quality checks
- Query performance tuning
- Working with cloud warehouses such as Azure SQL, Snowflake, BigQuery and Redshift
- Building datasets for Power BI

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Common Table Expressions
- Window functions
- Execution plans and index design
- Star and snowflake modelling
- Analytic aggregates
- Stored procedures and functions
- Partitioning and clustering

# Typescript and JavaScript (Fluent)

I use TypeScript and JavaScript across both frontend and backend work. TypeScript is my preferred choice because of the type system and the confidence it gives when building larger applications. My experience spans React, Next.js, Express and serverless workloads.

## Uses
- Full stack development
- React applications
- Next.js for server rendering and static generation
- Express backend APIs
- Serverless functions on AWS, Vercel and Cloudflare
- Schema validation using tools like Zod or Yup

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Advanced TypeScript types
- React with TypeScript
- Next.js routing and server components
- Express and Fastify
- REST and GraphQL integration
- Type safe API client generation

# NoSQL Dialects (Fluent)

I work with several NoSQL engines across AWS, Google Cloud and Azure. These systems are useful when dealing with flexible schemas, high throughput requirements or real time applications. I spend time designing the right document shapes and access patterns so that queries remain fast and predictable at scale.

## Uses
- Serverless application storage
- Real time data workloads
- Schema flexible document modelling
- Low latency reads and writes

## Ecosystem knowledge
- DynamoDB including GSIs and partition design
- Firestore including structure, security rules and indexing
- CosmosDB and RU optimisation
- Document modelling best practices
- Index and partition strategy

---

# DAX (Fluent)

DAX is a key part of how I build reliable analytics solutions in Power BI. I use it to define business logic, create reusable measures and structure semantic models. I aim to write DAX that is clear, predictable and efficient so reports perform well and are simple to maintain.

## Uses
- Building semantic models for BI
- Creating reusable measures
- Designing calculation groups
- Implementing business logic for dashboards

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Filter and row context
- Iterator functions
- Relationship behaviour
- Performance optimisation patterns

---

# KQL (Fluent)

I use KQL for working with log and event driven datasets, especially inside Microsoft Fabric. This includes analysing operational data, building time based charts and creating real time reporting. In Fabric Real Time Warehouses, I work with KQL query sets that feed visuals and monitor streaming activity.

## Uses
- Log analytics and diagnostics
- Time series analysis
- Real time reporting in Fabric Real Time Warehouses
- Monitoring streaming pipelines
- Operational dashboards

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Summarise, parse and extend
- Time series joins and make series
- Fabric KQL query sets
- Projection, filtering and ingestion patterns

---

# Power Fx (Fluent)

I use Power Fx when building Power Apps and creating logic inside Power Automate. It is particularly useful for handling form behaviour, updating data, controlling UI state and defining branching logic in workflows. It allows me to build useful tools quickly without heavy overhead.

## Uses
- Logic for Power Apps
- Power Automate expressions
- Form validation and state handling
- Patching and updating records
- Data driven UI behaviour

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Collections
- Patch and update operations
- Condition formulas
- Power Automate integration
- Data connectors and bindings

---

# C Sharp (Advanced)

I use C Sharp for backend services, automation, integration with Microsoft platforms and enterprise development. The .NET ecosystem provides strong tooling and a structured environment which is helpful for business applications that need stability and maintainability.

## Uses
- Integration with Microsoft services including Azure, Graph API and SharePoint
- Backend development using .NET and .NET Core
- Enterprise workflows and internal tools
- SQL Server and Entity Framework

## Ecosystem knowledge
- .NET Core
- Entity Framework
- LINQ
- Async programming
- Dependency injection
- Azure SDK for .NET
- Object oriented design patterns

# Dart (Intermediate)

I use Dart mainly through Flutter for mobile applications. I have built working apps and understand the core concepts behind widget based UI development, state management and navigation. Although I can work comfortably in Dart, I tend to prefer using React Native because it fits better with the rest of my development stack.

## Uses
- Mobile applications with Flutter
- State management using Provider, Riverpod or BLoC
- REST API integration
- Form validation
- Local storage using SharedPreferences or SQLite

## Ecosystem knowledge
- Flutter widget tree and layouts
- Streams and Futures
- Routing and navigation
- Theming and responsive layout
- Packages from pub.dev
