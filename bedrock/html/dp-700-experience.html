<h1>DP-700: Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate</h1>
<p>I recently took the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-data-engineer-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification">DP-700: Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate</a> exam and am now <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/PeterVenton-7649/A850B1056A30CBE8?sharingId=98B7CA95EDAFB390">certified</a>.</p>

<h2>Why I pursued it</h2>
<p>With the introduction of <strong>Microsoft Fabric</strong>, the data engineering landscape within the Microsoft ecosystem has evolved significantly. The DP-700 certification validates skills in <strong>designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines and analytics solutions</strong> that leverage Fabric’s unified architecture across Data Factory, DataFlows, Realtime Analytics, Pyspark, and Lakehouses.</p>
<p>For me, this certification was a natural next step after working extensively with <strong>Power BI, Python, and SQL</strong>. It offered a way to formalize my experience and stay ahead as the platform continues to unify analytics under Fabric.</p>

<h2>What the exam covers</h2>
<p>The DP-700 exam focuses on several key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingesting and transforming data</strong> using Dataflows Gen2, Pipelines, and Lakehouses</li>
<li><strong>Designing and implementing data models</strong> for performance and scalability</li>
<li><strong>Managing and optimizing data storage</strong> in OneLake</li>
<li><strong>Enabling analytics and business intelligence</strong> with Direct Lake and Power BI integration</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring, securing, and governing Fabric environments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it’s about understanding how all the Fabric components fit together to support an end-to-end data strategy.</p>

<li>Aleksi Partanen's 11 hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTDSP7KBavI">DP-700 Exam Full Course</a></li>
<li>Will's 6 hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiB4eAeFRsw">DP-700 Exam Full Course</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of this I gained hands on experience by leveraging the free 60 day Fabric trial from Microsoft to have access to play with Fabric and solidify my understanding of all the content.</p>
<p>Overall I studied for 4 weeks before taking the exam, scoring a 883/1000.</p>

<h2>My experience taking the exam</h2>
<p>The exam experience was relatively smooth <strong>40–50 questions</strong> covering a balance of conceptual design, and technical questions with a case study to evaluate a scenario based task.</p>
<p>For the conceptual design tasks I found it helpful to visualize Fabric as an ecosystem: knowing when to use Dataflows, Pipelines, and Lakehouses in combination was key.</p>
<p>For the techical questions its about knowing syntax, functions and method names. The easiest way to develop the skills needed in this section is to utilize a hands on approach, especially if you've never done any PySpark. the 3 topics covered are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PySpark / Fabric Notebooks</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you're familiar with Python/Pandas then this is mainly about learning PySpark syntax.</li>
<li>There were a few questions about the Fabric Specific Package NoteBookUtils, which asked how to orchestrate other notebooks from within a notebook (This is a question about NoteBookUtils <code>runMultiple()</code> method and the syntax of the dictionary to setup the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SQL</strong>
<ul>
<li>How to GRANT permission to objects in the database</li>
<li>Setting up RLS in SQL by creating a security predicate and binding it to a table</li>
<li>The different dynamic data masking (DDM) functions fabric supports and when to make use of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>KQL</strong>
<ul>
<li>How to create Materialized Views and what their use case is</li>
<li>How to create functions and their difference to SQL stored procedures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With Fabric now at the core of Microsoft’s analytics offering, this certification feels like a great foundation for future roles focused on <strong>data architecture, governance, and analytics enablement</strong>.<br>
I plan to continue exploring Fabric’s end-to-end capabilities, particularly <strong>Real-Time Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Data Activator</strong>. The next certification I'm chasing is the DP600:</p>
